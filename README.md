# Image Classification using PyTorch

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using PyTorch and a pre-trained ResNet-18 model on the Flower dataset. The trained model is saved and then used to predict the class of a new image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manikantpandey/Image-Classification-using-torch.git

    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Train the model:

    ```bash
    python training.py
    ```
