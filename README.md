# Image Classification using PyTorch

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform image classification using PyTorch and a pre-trained ResNet-18 model on the Flower dataset. The trained model is saved and then used to predict the class of a new image.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-classification-pytorch.git
    cd image-classification-pytorch
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Train the model:

    ```bash
    python training.py
    ```

4. Use the trained model for prediction:

    ```bash
    python predict.py path/to/image.jpg
    ```

    Replace `path/to/image.jpg` with the path to the image you want to classify.
